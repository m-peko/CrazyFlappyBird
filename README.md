</p>

Game is developed for Windows but, since Cocos2d-x is a cross-platform framework, C++ classes used in this project can also be used for Android and iOS deployment.

So far, game consists of only 4 scenes:
  - Splash scene
  - Main Menu scene
  - Game scene
  - Game Over scene

## Features:
  - each two pipes, i.e. obstacles, passed level increases
  - each pipe passed, score increases by 100 points
  - each dollar collected, score increases by 200 points

## How to start?
  - download latest Cocos2d-x version and extract it to a certain location
  - enter that location and `run setup.py` from terminal
  - run this command `cocos new CrazyFlappyBird -l cpp -d projects`
  - replace Classes and Resources directories with same directories from this repo
  - happy coding :)
