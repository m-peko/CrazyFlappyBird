</p>

Game is developed for Windows but, since Cocos2d-x is a cross-platform framework, C++ classes used in this project can also be used for Android and iOS deployment.

So far, game consists of only 4 scenes:
  - Splash scene
  - Main Menu scene
  - Game scene
  - Game Over scene

Leveling mechanism:
  - each two pipes, i.e. obstacles, passed level increases
